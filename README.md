# Youtube Kubecon-to-markdown  

**How to run?**  
### Getting the Presentation Slides:

- Get the schedule link and exact dates from Sched

eg. Link for Kubecon22 EU : [https://kccnceu2022.sched.com](https://kccnceu2022.sched.com)

    Dates : "2022-05-16" "2022-05-17" "2022-05-18" "2022-05-19" "2022-05-20"

- Execute the kubecon.sh script.
- You have to provide 2 arguments for -u flag (Link of site) 
and -d flag (dates for which you want the slides)
- You can provide a single date
```
./kubecon.sh -u https://kccnceu2022.sched.com -d "2022-05-17" 
```
- Or provide multiple dates at once.
```
./kubecon.sh -u "https://kccnceu2022.sched.com" -a "2022-05-16 2022-05-17 2022-05-18 2022-05-19"
```
It will start downloading the files in slides folder

### Getting the Presentation playlist and making the markdown file.:

Now that you have got Presentation slides it's time to create the markdown file (Presentation title along with Video link and slide link )

- Create a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv venv`, where the second venv is the name of the virtual environment
- Activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate`
- Import all the packages as per requirements.txt (Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in Terminal)
- Run this command `git checkout pull-feature` for getting the corresponding files
- Run `python3 youtuber.py`
- Enter the url of the corresponding playlist you wish to scrape
```
eg. Link for Kubecon EU 2022 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2MCEgkd8zH0vJWF7jdQ-GRR
```
- It will ask you to enter the start point of videos 
- Also to enter the end point of videos you wish to get
- Now the output is obtained in the markdown format to get the tabular display on the github repository. [Example](https://github.com/cloudyuga/kubecon19-china)  
- The output file by default is Output_mark.md
**Description:**  
This piece of code let us iterate through the playlist in youtube to track down the title and respective URLs.
It also prints out the formatting or say template.
In a way which can be copied to github as in markdown language for tabular display.  

### Debugging the file

There are chances that certain presentation files do not get matched with their correct presentation (either because there is a difference in name or some other reasons).
For those conditions you can check the files as follows:
- At the end of python execution you get the total number of files added to markdown.md, you can verify the number with total number of lines in kccncVideos.txt file (names of all slides downloaded by kubecon.sh)
- You can then look for the left out files by executing the commented lines of code (present at the last section of python file).
